# Challenge Question 2

class ShapeOps s where 
area :: s -> Double 
perimeter :: s -> Double 
data Circle = Circle Double 

instance ShapeOps Circle where 
    area (Circle r) = pi * r * r perimeter (Circle r) = 2 * pi * r 
    data Rectangle = Rectangle Double Double 
instance ShapeOps Rectangle where 
    area (Rectangle w h) = w * h 
    perimeter (Rectangle w h) = 2 * (w + h) 

#The typeclass defines a fixed bundle of operations 
#(like area and perimeter) that any new type must 
#implement, allowing new types to be added easily 
#while keeping all related operations grouped 
#together
